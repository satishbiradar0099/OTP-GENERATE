Step 1: Create a folder and files
Create a folder on your computer, e.g., OTPGENERATE

Inside that folder, create the following three files:

#index.html (Main HTML file that displays the OTP form)
#styles.css (For styling the OTP form)
#script.js (JavaScript to handle input and redirection)

Create another HTML file called success.html inside the same folder,
 which will be the page that opens after the OTP is submitted.
